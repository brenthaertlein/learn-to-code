# Learn To Code

This project serves as a repository of information for anyone learning the basics of computer
programming and other software development adjacent skills.

Contained within will be examples, links to additional resources and tools that can be used to
advance your understanding of software development.

## Insights

A short list of key insights that will be helpful

* [Google](https://www.duckduckgo.com) is your friend
    * The key takeaway here is that **research** is important. Many of the most common questions in
      programming have already been addressed for the **vast majority** of problems you will
      encounter in your effort to become a self-taught software developer
    * If you carefully craft your search terms, including **important keywords** and refining your
      search if the results are inadequate, you will likely stumble across additional resources that
      may contain helpful information
* There are no stupid questions, but remember *how* they were answered
    * One of the things most developers find is that they are answering the same questions
      repeatedly, even for themselves
    * Even if you can't remember the exact answer to every problem you've solved (you won't), it is
      very valuable to keep track of how you got to an answer
* Documentation is helpful. Like really helpful
    * Read the documentation associated with the resource or technology you are working with for a
      better understanding of how it works

## Getting started

The best way to get started learning about software development, or learning a new language, is with
practice! If you are a beginner or learning something completely new from scratch, even a basic
tutorial is a good way to give yourself a quick primer and familiarize yourself with new concepts

In any programming language, and especially when transitioning between them, there are often new
concepts that can seem daunting. Each language has its own syntax and keywords, which can lead to
frustrating errors if used improperly. One thing that many nascent developers may struggle with is
the concept of keywords. These reserved words are a part of the language (i.e. `var`, `const`, `let`
, `function` in JavaScript) and you can just take for granted that they work and behave in the way
that they do, the same way you can take for granted that a `+` or `-` operator works the same way as
it does in normal math.

Once you're trying to solve a problem or work on your first project, you will get stuck. You will
find that there are things you don't understand, and likely be frustrated in your attempts to find
the correct answer. This is a perfectly normal feeling, because new and hard to understand things
are absolutely frustrating. The best thing to do is take a deep breath, reach out for help from your
co-workers, peers or through an online resource like [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com).
Be calm, realize that if you could solve every problem right away that they probably wouldn't need
solving, and that when you do get to a solution that you even partially understand, it will be very
rewarding. Many developers solve the same, seemingly simple problems, many times over before they
really develop a full understanding of why they encountered the problem in the first place.

Repetition and steady progress is the name of the game, slowly building knowledge on top of prior
knowledge until you develop a firm understanding of basic concepts. A lot of the real acquired hard
skill expertise in software development comes from experience and
